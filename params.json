{"name":"Coreos-osx-gui","tagline":"CoreOS-Vagrant GUI for OS X","body":"CoreOS-Vagrant GUI for OS X\r\n============================\r\n\r\nCoreOS-Vagrant GUI for Mac OS X is a Mac Status bar App which works like a wrapper around the [coreos-vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant) command line tool. It supports only a standalone CoreOS VM, cluster one is at [CoreOS-Vagrant Cluster GUI](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui-cluster).\r\n \r\n[CoreOS](https://coreos.com) is a Linux distribution made specifically to run [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) containers.\r\n[CoreOS-Vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant) is made to run on VirtualBox and VMWare VMs.\r\n\r\n![CoreOS-Vagrant-GUI L](coreos-vagrant-gui.png \"CoreOS-Vagrant-GUI\")\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\nHead over to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui/releases) to grab the latest ZIP file.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRequired software\r\n* [VirtualBox for Mac OS X hosts](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant for Mac OS X](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads)\r\n\r\n* Download `CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI latest.zip` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui/releases) and unzip it.\r\n* Start the `CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI` and from menu `Setup` choose `Initial setup of CoreOS-Vagrant` \r\n* The install will do the following:\r\n````\r\n1) All dependent files/folders will be put under \"coreos-osx\" folder in the user's home folder e.g /Users/someuser/coreos-osx\r\n2) Will clone latest coreos-vagrant from git\r\n3) user-data file will have fleet, etcd, and Docker Socket for the API enabled\r\n4) docker 2375 port will be set for docker OS X client to work properly\r\n5) Will set VM to static IP '172.17.8.99' \r\n6) Will download and install fleet, etcd and docker OS X clients to ~/coreos-osx/bin/\r\n7) Will download latest vagrant VBox and run vagrant up to initialise VM\r\n8) Will forward 2375 (docker) from localhost to vagrant VM.\r\n9) Will install DockerUI and Fleet-UI via fleet unit files from ~/coreos-osx/fleet folder.\r\n10) Via IP 172.17.8.99 you can access any port on CoreOS VM, no needs to put port forwards to Vagrantfile.\r\n````\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nJust start `CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI` application and you will find a small icon with the CoreOS logo in the Status Bar.\r\nFor now it only supports a standalone CoreOS VM, cluster support might come at some stage later one.\r\n\r\n* There you can `Up`, `Suspend`, `Halt`, `Reload` CoreOS vagrant VM\r\n* Under `Up & OS shell` OS Shell will be opened when `vagrant up` finishes and it will have such environment set:\r\n````\r\nDOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375\r\nFLEETCTL_TUNNEL=127.0.0.1:2222\r\nPath to ~/coreos-osx/bin where docker, etcdclt and fleetctl binaries are stored\r\nssh-add ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key for the fleetctl tunnel to work properly\r\n```` \r\n* `Updates/Force CoreOS update` will run `sudo update_engine_client -update` on CoreOS VM.\r\n* `Updates/Check for updates` will update docker, etcdclt and fleetctl OS X clients to the same versions as CoreOS VM runs. It will store downloads from github `coreos-vagrant` in `~/coreos-osx/github` folder, it will not overwrite user's `Vagrantfile, config.rb and users-data` files.\r\n* `SSH` will open VM shell\r\n* [Fleet-UI](http://fleetui.com) will show running fleet units and etc (it might take a bit of a time after install for it to work as it needs to download it's image\r\n* [DockerUI](https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui) will show all running containers and etc (it might take a bit of a time after install for it to work as it needs to download it's image)\r\n* Also user-data file enables with the flag `--insecure-registry` as per [CoreOS Blog](https://coreos.com/blog/docker-1-3-2-security-update/) Docker access to insecure private registries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther links\r\n-----------\r\n* Cluster one CoreOS VM App can be found here [CoreOS-Vagrant Cluster GUI](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui-cluster).\r\n* Also you might like my other [boot2docker GUI for OS X](https://github.com/rimusz/boot2docker-gui-osx) project for [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
